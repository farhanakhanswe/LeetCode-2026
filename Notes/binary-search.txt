(1) What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array/list.

Works only on sorted data

Uses a divide-and-conquer approach

Much faster than linear search for large datasets

(2) How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Find the middle element of the array.

Compare the middle element with the target:

If equal → Found

If target < middle → Search left half

If target > middle → Search right half
